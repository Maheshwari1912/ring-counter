**AIM OF RING COUNTER:**

The aim of a ring counter is to design and implement a sequential digital circuit that generates a cyclic pattern of binary states. 

Each state contains only one high (1) bit, with the rest being low (0), and the high bit shifts position with every clock pulse. 

Ring counters are commonly used in applications such as: 

• Sequence generation 

• Control logic for finite state machines 

• LED chasers or display systems
